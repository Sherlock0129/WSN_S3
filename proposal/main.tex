\title{\textbf{A Scalable Hierarchical Wireless Power Transfer System Based on Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces for Complex-Environment Wireless Sensor Networks}}
\author{WSN S3 Project Team}
\date{\today}

\begin{document}
\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Large-scale Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) deployed in mountains, forests, industrial sites, and other complex environments face a fundamental challenge: long-term sustainable energy supply. Traditional approaches such as batteries and solar harvesting are unreliable in shaded, occluded, or non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. Meanwhile, long-range Radio Frequency Wireless Power Transfer (RF WPT) suffers from severe path loss in obstructed terrains, and Magnetic Resonant Coupling (MRC) WPT is highly sensitive to coil misalignment, limiting its robustness in outdoor applications.

This project proposes a scalable and extensible \textbf{hierarchical hybrid WPT architecture} supported by \textbf{Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS)}. At the global layer, multiple RIS panels form controllable multi-hop reflective power pathways enabling long-range RF energy routing across mountains or obstacles. At the local (cluster) layer, programmable metasurfaces act as \textbf{near-field energy lenses}, enhancing magnetic coupling efficiency and misalignment tolerance for MRC WPT. At the network layer, a unified \textbf{RF--RIS--MRC–WSN energy flow model} coordinates end-to-end energy delivery.

The proposed system is not only energy efficient but also inherently \textbf{scalable} (supporting large-scale WSN expansion) and \textbf{extensible} (compatible with UAV-mounted RIS, mobile robots, 6G IoE networks, and future intelligent energy infrastructure). The project integrates theoretical modeling, electromagnetic simulation, hardware prototyping, and systematic validation to deliver an engineering-ready wireless energy ecosystem.

\section{Background and Significance}

\subsection{Background}

WSNs are widely deployed for environmental monitoring, agriculture, forest fire prevention, border surveillance, and industrial equipment management. However, in real-world terrain—mountains, forests, canyons—WSN nodes face severe limitations:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Unpredictable energy availability}: solar energy fluctuates heavily due to terrain occlusion.
  \item \textbf{No line-of-sight RF conditions}: mountains and obstacles drastically attenuate WPT signals.
  \item \textbf{Maintenance costs}: manually replacing batteries is infeasible for large-scale deployments.
  \item \textbf{Harsh spatial constraints}: MRC WPT cannot maintain efficiency under coil misalignment, tilting, or movement.
\end{itemize}

Recent progress in RIS offers a new opportunity: using programmable metasurfaces to engineer electromagnetic propagation for both long-range and near-field energy transfer.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Significance}

This project integrates RF WPT, MRC WPT, and RIS into a \textbf{multi-layer, multi-scale hybrid WPT ecosystem}, addressing both long-range reachability and local high-efficiency power delivery.

Significance includes:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Solving NLOS long-range power delivery} via RIS-based controllable RF energy routing.
  \item \textbf{Enhancing near-field coupling efficiency} using RIS as a magnetic energy lens.
  \item \textbf{Establishing a unified cross-layer energy flow framework} for RF--RIS--MRC--WSN.
  \item \textbf{Supporting scalable WSN deployments}: RIS-assisted power networks can expand seamlessly with network size.
  \item \textbf{Providing extensibility to future intelligent energy systems}: RIS-enabled energy routing can interface with UAVs, mobile robots, and 6G IoE smart environments.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Related Work and Limitations}

\subsection{RIS-assisted RF Wireless Power Transfer}

Existing studies show that RIS can improve RF WPT performance by redirecting and focusing incident waves. However:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Most work focuses on \textbf{single RIS panels} in indoor scenarios.
  \item Very limited research addresses \textbf{multi-RIS cooperative power routing}.
  \item No existing work handles \textbf{mountainous terrains or multi-obstacle outdoor environments}.
\end{itemize}

  \label{fig:self-powered-ris}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Metasurface-enhanced Magnetic Resonant Coupling}

Metasurfaces have been tested to improve magnetic coupling efficiency, but:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Studies mainly use fixed, non-programmable metasurfaces.
  \item Theoretical understanding of \textbf{near-field focusing and misalignment compensation} is incomplete.
  \item Integration with real WSN deployments is missing.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Energy Management in WSNs}

Traditional energy scheduling approaches (harvesting-oriented, SWIPT, duty-cycling) are not sufficient because:

\begin{itemize}
  \item They assume limited or uncontrollable energy inflow.
  \item They do not consider \textbf{joint RF–MRC energy flows}.
  \item None incorporate RIS as an active energy-routing infrastructure.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Gaps Addressed by This Project}

The project targets the following gaps:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Multi-RIS cooperative \textbf{energy routing} across non-line-of-sight terrains.
  \item RIS-enabled \textbf{magnetic energy lensing} for robust MRC power transfer.
  \item A unified \textbf{cross-layer energy flow model}.
  \item A \textbf{scalable and extensible WPT architecture} for real-world large-scale WSNs.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Key Scientific Problem}

The core scientific challenge of this project can be summarized as:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{How to design, model, and optimize a scalable hierarchical RF--RIS--MRC wireless power transfer system that can reliably deliver energy across complex non-line-of-sight environments and efficiently power large-scale WSN deployments, while coordinating long-range RF energy routing and near-field magnetic resonant charging in a unified framework?}
\end{quote}

This overarching problem naturally decomposes into the following tightly coupled subproblems.

\subsection*{Subproblem 1: Multi-RIS Cooperative Energy Routing in NLOS Environments}

How can we construct and optimize multi-hop, RIS-assisted RF energy paths in complex terrains where direct line-of-sight links do not exist?

\begin{itemize}
  \item How to model multi-RIS cascaded reflective channels over real terrain (e.g., mountains, obstacles) and incorporate terrain elevation and shadowing into energy routing?
  \item How to jointly design energy routing paths and RIS phase configurations to maximize received power, minimize path loss, or balance energy among multiple clusters?
  \item How to maintain robustness against environmental changes (e.g., foliage, partial blockage) and support scalable extension to additional RIS panels and WSN clusters?
\end{itemize}

  \label{fig:ris-routing}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Subproblem 2: RIS-enhanced MRC for Near-field Energy Focusing and Robustness}

How can programmable metasurfaces be used as near-field energy lenses to enhance magnetic resonant coupling efficiency and misalignment tolerance within each cluster?

\begin{itemize}
  \item What are the underlying mechanisms by which RIS structures reshape the near-field magnetic distribution and improve the coupling coefficient, quality factor, and end-to-end efficiency?
  \item How do RIS structural parameters (unit cell geometry, periodicity, material properties) affect the trade-off between focusing strength, efficiency, and robustness to coil displacement and rotation?
  \item How can we design adaptive RIS control patterns that compensate for spatial drift or position uncertainty of sensor nodes in realistic deployments?
\end{itemize}
